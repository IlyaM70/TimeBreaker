This is a program that I write for myself.
The main function of the program is to remind the user to take a break while working at the computer.

Program functions:
- count down the time until the break
- count down the time until the end of the break
- pause and run the countdown until the break
- skip a break
- restart the countdown to the break
- sound signals:
	. 30 seconds before break
	. break signal
	. break end signal
	. relaxing music during break
- the program can minimized to tray
- during the break, a small window pops up with the countdown until the end of the break
